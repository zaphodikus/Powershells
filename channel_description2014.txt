<![CDATA[Get comfortable and listen to Kate Lees our minister at a tiny community church. <br/>
We record most Sundays, but sometimes the equipment beats us, or we are just having more community spirit than we should. Our minister Kate Lees and our leadership team do change it up a lot. This podcast will be broken into seasons or years as a separate feed to make it easier to manage.<br/>
